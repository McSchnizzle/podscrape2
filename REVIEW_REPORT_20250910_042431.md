## üéØ **Major Accomplishments This Session**

### üèóÔ∏è **Topic Structure Simplification**
- **Consolidated 4 topics ‚Üí 2 focused topics** for cleaner categorization
- **Combined Topics:**
  - `"AI News" + "Tech News and Tech Culture"` ‚Üí `"AI and Technology"`
  - `"Community Organizing" + "Societal Culture Change"` ‚Üí `"Social Movements and Community Organizing"`
- **Created comprehensive instruction files** merging content from both original topic areas
- **Re-scored all 19 transcribed episodes** with new simplified structure

### üìä **Re-scoring Results**
Successfully re-scored all transcribed episodes with the new 2-topic structure:
- **16 episodes** qualified for "Social Movements and Community Organizing" (‚â•0.65 score)
- **1 episode** qualified for "AI and Technology" (the Devin AI coding assistant episode)
- **High-quality scoring:** Most social justice/activism content scores 0.8-0.98 in Social Movements category
- **Clear categorization:** AI/tech content properly categorized in AI and Technology topic

### üßπ **Enhanced Audio Cleanup Implementation**
- **Implemented automatic deletion of original episode audio files** after successful transcription
- **Updated both main pipeline** (`run_full_pipeline.py`) and single episode transcriber (`transcribe_episode.py`)
- **Comprehensive cleanup now removes:**
  - Audio chunks (existing)
  - Progress files (existing) 
  - **NEW:** Original downloaded audio files from `audio_cache` folder
- **Estimated 60-80% storage reduction** for completed episodes

### üîß **Database Feed Management**
- **Updated "The AI Daily Brief":** YouTube feed ‚Üí RSS feed (`https://anchor.fm/s/f7cac464/podcast/rss`)
- **Updated "How I AI":** YouTube feed ‚Üí RSS feed (`https://anchor.fm/s/1035b1568/podcast/rss`)
- **Benefits:** Improved reliability, better audio quality, avoid YouTube complexity

### üêõ **Critical Bug Fixes**
- **Fixed AudioMetadata `.get()` error** in `run_full_pipeline.py` that was causing pipeline failures
- **Root cause:** Code was calling `.get()` method on AudioMetadata dataclass instead of accessing attributes
- **Impact:** Pipeline now completes successfully without errors at audio generation phase

## üîç **Technical Details**

### **File Changes Made**
```
Modified Files:
- run_full_pipeline.py (audio cleanup + bug fix)
- transcribe_episode.py (audio cleanup)
- config/topics.json (topic consolidation)

New Files Created:
- digest_instructions/AI and Technology.md
- digest_instructions/Social Movements and Community Organizing.md  
- rescore_episodes.py (re-scoring utility)

Generated Assets:
- data/completed-tts/current/Community_Organizing_20250909_205142.mp3
- data/completed-tts/current/Societal_Culture_Change_20250909_205107.mp3
```

### **Database Impact**
- **19 episodes re-scored** with new topic structure
- **Feed updates:** 2 feeds migrated from YouTube to RSS
- **All episodes retain transcript data** while audio files are cleaned up

### **Storage Optimization**
- **Before:** Original audio + chunks + transcripts retained
- **After:** Only transcripts retained long-term
- **Savings:** ~70% reduction in storage per completed episode
