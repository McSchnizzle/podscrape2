# Psychedelics and Spirituality — Digest Instructions

## Topic Focus
Curate segments that explore the intersection of altered states and meaning-making, including:
- Religious and contemplative traditions (Buddhism, Hinduism, Christian mysticism, Sufism, indigenous ceremony)
- Meditation and contemplative practice (mindfulness, vipassana, zazen, breathwork)
- Psychedelics and entheogens (psilocybin, ayahuasca, LSD, MDMA, mescaline, DMT), therapeutic and ceremonial use
- Mystical experiences, non‑dual awareness, consciousness research, neurotheology
- Astrology, archetypal symbolism, ritual, and myth as frameworks of meaning
- Somatic practices, trauma healing, and the felt sense of energetic connection between people and the universe
